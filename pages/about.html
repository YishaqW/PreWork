  <p class="child-paragraphs4"> &#11088 Fun Fact: My name is pronounced (Ye-Sock), which is Hebrew for, Issac. Or "He Laughs", ironically that's what I end up doing now. You see, I use to hate my name and often questioned if my parents may have hated me. But since maturing and understanding the deep history behind this 6-letter word. I learned to love to it and say it proudly! </p>
    <br>
  <p class="child-paragraphs4"> &#11088 I'm originally born and raised in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Moved over to the Untied States at a very young age. Residing in a few cities in Montgomery County, Maryland, from then on.  And by the grace of <a href="http://www.hbkyohannes.org" target="_blank" id="GOD">GOD!</a> I am here today on this mission with you all! </p>
    <br>
  <p class="child-paragraphs4"> &#11088 I enjoy using creative mediums such as web development and photography. I love learning about cultures and languages. I look forward to a good read. And when the weather is right, shooting some hoops or going for a nice run.  </p>
    <br>
  <p class="child-paragraphs4"> &#11088 I also love to watch <a href="https://youtu.be/g53BScYTixs" target="_blank" id="christian" target="_blank">YOTC&#169</a> on Youtube, gatherings with my family, talking to friends, and eating whatever my mother is cooking! </p>
